# Solutions: The solutions your model provides. Consider other possible solutions and different starting situations, how would your model work?

# Methods: Compare different solutions with each other

# Results: Explain the results your solution of choice provides. Discuss the robustness and/or weakness of your solution. Try to consider your model's performance as broadly as possible.

# Summary: Summarise your results, the strengths and weaknesses of your model, and discuss what could be done further.
